## Results

The following table describes our generated results and their corresponding input audio clips. Each audio clip in the "result" column has been generated by transferring the style of the audio in the "style" column onto the content of the audio clip in the "content" column. 

Each link in the the table will direct you to one of our audio clips on soundcloud.

We can categorize our generated results based on the type of content and/or style audios. Some of the categories we chose were instrumental music, human voice, animal sounds, etc. There are some specific types of audios for which the notion of style transfer in the context of audios makes more sense naturally. For example, transferring the style of a male voice onto the content of a female voice is a more natural transfer compared to a music-to-voice style transfer.

Please note that measuring the meaningfulness of our results (accuracy of our algorithm) is a challenging and open ended task since there is no formulated accuracy metric or predefined accuracy criteria for quantifying the quality of our results generated by audio style transfer algorithm. To investigate results, we have designed a survey for estimating the accuracy of our results.
